## Embedded MP3 Player
### About
Created and verified the implementation of MP3 player on Texas Instruments TM4C1294 ARM microcontroller. Implemented hardware peripheral drivers such as a keyboard input, an LED screen, an SD card reader, and an audio jack using I2C and UART communication protocols. Used interrupts to prioritize a target audio sampling rate of 44.1kHz while concurrently maintaining an LED screen and user button functions in C.

### How to run
This project is designed for the Tiva C series microcontrollers from Texas Instruments, specifically it uses the TM4C1294 microcontroller. To run this code, just import to code composer studio provided by Texas Instruments and run on the TM4C1294 development board.
